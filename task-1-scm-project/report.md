# Task 1: Evaluating Source Code Management (SCM) Tools

## Introduction

This task involved evaluating different Source Code Management (SCM) tools, particularly centralized and distributed version control systems. The purpose was to understand how distributed teams can benefit from using Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) like Git over centralized systems like Subversion (SVN). The project scenario assumes a shift from a centralized model to a distributed model, making it important to choose the right tool for collaboration and scalability.

## Centralized vs Distributed VCS

Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS), like SVN, rely on a single central server. Developers pull code from and push changes to this server. If the server is down or inaccessible, work is interrupted. These systems also pose a risk of data loss if the central repository becomes corrupted or is not backed up.

In contrast, Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS), like Git, allow every developer to have a complete copy of the entire project history. This makes it possible to commit, browse history, and manage branches without needing internet access. DVCS tools are faster, safer, and more suitable for modern software development environments.

## Why Git Is the Right Choice

Git provides significant advantages over traditional centralized systems:

- **Speed**: Git is faster because it operates locally.
- **Offline Access**: Developers can commit and view history even without internet.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git makes it easy to work on multiple features through branches and later merge them cleanly.
- **Open Source and Extensible**: Git integrates well with tools like GitHub, GitLab, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Every clone acts as a backup, eliminating single points of failure.
- **Adoption**: Git is widely used, which means it has a strong community and support base.

## Challenges of Using Git

Despite its advantages, Git also presents some challenges:

- **Learning Curve**: Beginners might find Gitâ€™s terminology and commands difficult at first.
- **Merge Conflicts**: When multiple people edit the same file, resolving conflicts can be tricky.
- **Security Management**: Proper access controls and signed commits need to be enforced manually.

## Benefits for Distributed Teams

DVCS tools like Git are ideal for distributed teams because:

- **Local Repositories**: Developers can work independently without needing a constant connection to a central server.
- **Collaboration Support**: Tools like pull requests and code reviews enhance collaborative coding.
- **Asynchronous Workflows**: Developers across time zones can contribute on their schedule.
- **Efficient Conflict Resolution**: With proper workflows, conflicts are minimized and resolved easily.

## Conclusion

After evaluating both centralized and distributed SCM tools, Git stands out as the best option for managing code in a distributed development environment. It supports modern development practices, improves collaboration, and offers flexibility, speed, and robustness for individual and collaborative work.
